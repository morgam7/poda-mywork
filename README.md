# Palmer Penguins Project

This is the repository for my project for the Principles of Data Analytics module of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics given by ATU Galway-Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics). My lecturer was [Ian McLoughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin).

In this project I analyse the [Palmer Penguin Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html) with the new skills Ian taught us in this module. 

## Why This Project is useful

This is the first module of a two year course and I have no previous experience coding or working with datasets. So it is unlikely I will be adding much to the Palmer Penguin dataset literature! But this project might be useful for people who are just starting out with data analytics. Or for future students of ATU's data analytics course. It might help with figuring out how to tackle the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with using this repository you will first need to install Python installed and the best way to do that is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

You will also need some sort of notebook editor. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can also use Google Collab. Here's a handy button to press for that:

  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

It will open this notebook in [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). I used [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the badge.

Once you have what you need installed on your computer, then you can clone the repository down to your own machine, open it in Visual Studio Code or just have Visual Studio Code clone it for you and then you can run the notebook.

## Libraries

These are the python libraries I used in the project:

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library, offering data structures like DataFrame for handling structured data effectively.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating a wide range of static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

NumPy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.

Warnings: The warnings module is used to handle warning messages, and warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') suppresses these warnings to improve the clarity of the output.
